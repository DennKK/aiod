# AI Odyssey Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the **AI Odyssey** project setup guide! This step-by-step tutorial is designed for users with limited programming experience. Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your machine.

## Step 1: Download the Project

1. Visit the project's GitHub page.
2. Click on the `Code` button.
3. Select `Download ZIP` from the dropdown menu.
4. Save the ZIP file to your computer and extract it to a location of your choice.

## Step 2: Open the Project

Open the project directory using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.

## Step 3: Install Docker Desktop

1. Navigate to [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download Docker Desktop for your operating system.
2. Follow the installer's instructions to install Docker Desktop on your system.

## Step 4: Open the Project Terminal

Within your development environment, open the built-in terminal. Ensure the terminal's current directory is set to the root of your project.

## Step 5: Run Docker Compose

Execute the following command in the terminal: 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will start all the necessary Docker containers as defined in your project's `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Step 6: Await Build Completion

The process of building and launching your Docker containers can take some time, especially on the first run. Keep an eye on the terminal output to monitor the progress. The build is complete when the terminal output slows and logs indicate that services are running.

## Step 7: Access the Project in a Browser

After the Docker containers have been successfully started:

1. Open any web browser.
2. Type `localhost:8181` or `http://localhost:8181` into the address bar.
3. Hit Enter, and you should be greeted by the project's landing page or user interface.

## Additional Information

- **Docker Login Issues**: If you face any errors related to Docker, make sure you are logged into your Docker account. Docker Desktop may require you to sign in to download and manage containers.

- **Checking Port Availability**: Before starting, ensure that port `8181` is not being used by another application. If it is, or if you encounter a port conflict error, you can change the port configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file to a free port and access the application via that port instead.

- **Documentation and Help**: For more comprehensive guidance, the Docker and Docker Compose official documentation are invaluable resources. Additionally, if you run into issues or have questions, the project's GitHub issues page is a good place to seek help.

Congratulations on setting up the **AI Odyssey** project! Dive into its features and functionalities. Should you encounter any stumbling blocks or have queries, do not hesitate to reach out to the project's maintainers or consult the project's GitHub issue tracker for assistance.
